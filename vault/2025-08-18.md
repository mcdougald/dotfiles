I am FUUUUCCCKKKKED. My right arm has randomly started hurting :\ We'll see if I live past 30.

This war vs my management is so tolling... Somedays feel like a losing battle, others feel like I'm winning the war.

Lately I've been missing Savannah a lot? She almost killed me and ruined me life. SHE WASN'T FAITHFUL. It technically wasn't her fault since she was almost damn retarded with mood-swings and brain chemistry at times. She knows that and wouldn't ever take any accountability.

Maybe in my 40s if I'm a bachelor and father I'll fuck with her. For now, it's the grind I'm married to. And I will win this mfing war.
